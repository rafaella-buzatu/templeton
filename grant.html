                        The Templeton Foundation has financed this project under Grant ID 62572 as part of their genetics research support directive.
                        “The mission of the John Templeton Foundation is to support interdisciplinary research and catalyze conversations that inspire awe and wonder. We are working to create a world where people are curious about the wonders of the universe, free to pursue lives of meaning and purpose, and motivated by great and selfless love.”

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> The fact that neurons and other types of cells in the human body are rarely replaced raises the question of the genetic mechanisms that enable cells to function properly for decades and possibly 100 years or more. The popular “free-radical aging” and “rate of living” theories, and the Hayflick phenomenon, fail to adequately explain such extreme cellular longevity. Nevertheless, these ideas affect human behavior e.g. intake of antioxidant supplements and experimental rejuvenation therapy.
                    Our project will investigate a new direction that connects the efficiency of stress response to cellular and animal lifespan, and analyze a candidate genetic mechanism. We will create models of cells that are rarely replaced, e.g. neurons, and cells with limited lifespan, e.g. fibroblasts, from exceptionally long living, and short living mammals. We will expose cells to repeated stress stimuli while monitoring their viability by high throughput microscopy. Moreover, we will analyze the mammalian long noncoding RNA gene NEAT1 orchestrating the assembly of specialized stress-induced complexes, named paraspeckles. We identified key components of the paraspeckle-RNA-metabolism-protein quality axis (e.g. Mol. Cell 2019, BMC Biology 2020), and our preliminary analysis indicates high homology among long living mammals. Based on putative connections to lifespan, we will analyze the phylogeny of NEAT1, and overexpress paraspeckles to quantify stress protection effect in each species. To validate mechanisms, we will transfer NEAT1 from mammals with highly efficient stress protection to less efficient cells.
                    </p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;"> The project will deliver answers on the ability of cells to withstand prolonged stress in relation to animal lifespan, paraspeckles function, and their evolution. If successful, a new theory and model of cellular lifespan will be established, paving ways to investigate and prevent age-related frailty. The multispecies stem cell approach will open new avenues for evolution and genetics.

                    <p style="text-align: justify; flex: 1;">Embryos from different mammalian species develop at characteristic timescales. These timescales are recapitulated during the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. Specific genes and molecular pathways that modulate cell differentiation speed between mammalian species remain to be determined. Here we use single-cell multi-omic analysis of neural differentiation of mouse, cynomolgus and human pluripotent cells to identify regulators for differentiation speed. We demonstrate that species-specific transcriptome dynamics are mirrored at the chromatin level, but that the speed of neural differentiation is insensitive to manipulations of cell growth and cycling. Exploiting the single-cell resolution of our data, we identify glycogen storage levels regulated by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) as a species-dependent trait of pluripotent cells, and show that lowered glycogen storage in UGP2 mutant cells is associated with accelerated neural differentiation. The control of energy storage could be a general strategy for the regulation of cell differentiation speed.
